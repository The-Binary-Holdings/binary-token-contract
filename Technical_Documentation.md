# BNRY Token - Technical Document

## Overview
The BNRY Token (Binary Coin) is a standard ERC20 token with extended functionalities, designed to be used within the Binary Layer 2 blockchain ecosystem. This document provides an overview of the system's architecture, the problem it aims to solve, and the intended functionalities of the systemâ€™s components.

## System Architecture

### Smart Contract Overview
The BNRY Token is implemented as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity. The contract leverages OpenZeppelin's libraries for secure and efficient development. The key components of the contract are:

- **ERC20**: Standard token functionality including transfer, approval, and allowance mechanisms.
- **ERC20Burnable**: Allows token holders to burn their tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **ERC20Permit**: Implements EIP-2612, allowing for approvals to be made via signatures, reducing gas costs.
- **ERC20Votes**: Enables voting mechanisms, allowing token holders to participate in governance.

### Initial Supply
The total initial supply of the BNRY token is 10 billion tokens, which are minted to the admin address upon deployment. This supply is fixed and can only decrease via the burning mechanism.

### Key Functions
- **Burn Functionality**: Users can burn tokens from their own balance, which permanently removes them from circulation.
- **Permit Functionality**: Users can approve token transfers without requiring a transaction (and therefore gas) through the use of signatures.
- **Voting Functionality**: Token holders can delegate their voting power and participate in governance processes.

## Problem Statement
The BNRY Token is designed to be the core utility and governance token within the Binary Layer 2 blockchain. The token is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. By integrating burnable, permit, and voting functionalities, the BNRY token ensures that users can efficiently manage their holdings, participate in the decision-making process, and maintain a deflationary token economy.

## Functionality of System Components

### Burn Function
- **Description**: Allows users to burn tokens, reducing the total supply.
- **Use Case**: This function can be used to control the inflation rate of the token or as a way to reward users by allowing them to burn their tokens.

### Permit Function
- **Description**: Implements EIP-2612, allowing for gasless token approvals.
- **Use Case**: This is particularly useful for decentralized applications (dApps) where users want to authorize token spending without paying gas fees for the approval transaction.

### Voting Function
- **Description**: Allows token holders to participate in governance by voting on proposals.
- **Use Case**: Essential for decentralized governance, enabling token holders to influence the direction of the project.

## Critical Modules
- **ERC20Burnable**: Responsible for reducing the token supply.
- **ERC20Permit**: Facilitates off-chain token approvals.
- **ERC20Votes**: Manages voting and delegation functionalities.

## Security Considerations
Given the critical role of the BNRY token within the ecosystem, security is of utmost importance. Key concerns include:

- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Ensuring no reentrancy vulnerabilities exist in the burn function.
- **Signature Replay Attacks**: Protecting the permit functionality against replay attacks by ensuring proper nonce management.
- **Governance Attacks**: Safeguarding the voting system from malicious governance proposals.

## Audit Scope
The audit will focus on the following areas:
1. **Token Transfer Mechanisms**: Ensuring secure and efficient transfers.
2. **Burn Function**: Validating that tokens are correctly removed from supply and cannot be recovered.
3. **Permit Function**: Ensuring that signature-based approvals are secure.
4. **Voting Mechanism**: Confirming that voting power is correctly calculated and cannot be manipulated.

## Conclusion
The BNRY Token is a comprehensive and secure utility token designed to serve as the backbone of the Binary Layer 2 blockchain. Its integration of advanced functionalities such as burning, gasless approvals, and voting makes it a versatile tool for users within the ecosystem.
